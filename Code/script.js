/* Write a program that allows a user to decide between rock, paper, or scissors. 
Also create a random index for the computer to randomly choose between rock, paper, or scissors. 
Each time that both the computer and the user have made their selection, 
compare the two choices to determine the winner and keep score by adding 1 point to either the computer or the user. 
The first player to 5 points wins, then the game resets. */
